01 rem i will be our counter for the loop
02 let i = 0
03 rem d will hold the sum of the incoming numbers
04 let d = 0
05 rem this is our loop control.  since i = 0 and we want 7 numbers we increment to 6 when its don we exit loop area
06 if i == 6 goto 16
07 rem were using c to store the user input
08 input c
09 rem add the value of c to d
10 let d = d + c
11 rem increment the counter
12 let i = i + 1
13 rem go back to the if statement for the loop
14 goto 06 
15 rem loops done so divide by seven for the average
16 let d = d / 7
17 rem print the average for the user to see
18 print d
19 end
