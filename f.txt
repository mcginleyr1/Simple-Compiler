01 rem setting up i for loop
02 let i = 1
03 rem setting c to hold the sum
04 let c = 0
05 rem our loop tests for when i is greater then 9
06 if i > 9 goto 14
07 rem add i to the sum of odds
08 let c = c + i
09 rem increment i by 2 so it stays odd
10 let i = i + 2
11 rem go back to loop test
12 goto 06
13 rem print the final value
